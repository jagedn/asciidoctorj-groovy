== Numbers

Groovy can easily be used to calculate:

[groovy]
5+30

it even can cope with high precision since it uses BigDecimals

[groovy]
1024.0*1024.0*1024.0*1024.0*1024.0

or to display the current date and time:

[groovy]
new Date()

== Strings

Multi-Line statements do also work:

.Simple Hello-World
[groovy]
b="binding?" 
a = "hello \n"
a += "world"

[groovy]
println a
a+" test binding"+b
